#
# Terminology:
#   Boolean values can be "true" or "false".
#   Whenever "n" or "N" is mentioned, it means "a number".
#   Options using "whole" numbers (natural), can't have decimals.
#   Only options that use decimal points (real number) can use them.
#   Options that have a colon (:), are groups of numbers
#       (Example: group1:group2,group2,group2:group3,group3)
#
# Option values that are invalid (A number where you should
#  use a boolean, will be ignored. The default value will
#  be used instead. Check the server.log file and/or the
#  server console. All option values being used are printed
#  out there!).
#
# Option values that are lower than the minimum, or higher than
#  the maximum are raised to their minimum, and lowered to their
#  maximum values respectively.
#
# Maximum numbers being 2147483687 are the largest value that
#  an Integer type value can be. If you set it higher than
#  that, an exception will be thrown and the config will not
#  load properly.
#

#
# This option was added in version 1.1.3.

# Modifies the chance for a rare item to become supreme instead.
# By default, a player has a 1 in 3600 chance to open a 20 seconds
# long rarity window (about once per hour). A single action done
# within that window, which can be extended by deed bonus, will
# cause a moment of inspiration.
#
# Ignoring the fact that the rarity system was nerfed, to an additional
# chance of 1 in 4 of the action actually succeeding, that's statisticly
# a 1 in 180 (or 0.56 %) chance.
#
# We use that chance to open a rarity window of 1 second, and then
# it's an additional 1 in 10000 (or 0.01 %) chance to become fantastic.
#
# If it's not fantastic, it's a 1 in 100 (or 1 %) chance to be supreme.
#
# Otherwise it's a 1 in 2 (or 50 %) chance to be at least rare.
#

# Here's a small rundown of skill checks used when treasure maps are
# created, and a skill check is involved. Maybe this will help you to
# find the right map base difficulty that you are personally looking
# for on your server.
#
# Keep in mind that the base difficulty is reduced by skill levels
# and tool QL (mining, digging, fishing rod, et cetera) by 1/10th
# of their value, and by 5 for each rarity level of the tool. Or the
# average "Fighting" skill of the players that killed a creature
# respectively.
#
# If the average FS of a group of players is 60, and the base map
# difficulty was 50, it would reduce the difficuly by 60 % of the
# difference between base map difficulty, and the minimum difficuly
# (which is 4).
#
# Difficulty = (50 - 4) * 60 % = 27.6.
#
# The skill check is then performed against the "Weaponless fighting"
# skill of the killed creature (because they don't usually have any
# other skills).
